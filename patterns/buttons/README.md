As the special button uses the accent colour, Special & Regular should be alternated based on the importance of the action.

-The special button is to be used for the most important action(s) available (e.g. Submit, Send)

-The regular button is to be used where the background is a light colour

-The light button is to be used for any button on a dark background, or to compliment the primary button

-The ghost button should only be used when overlayed on an image, especially on the dog cards.
